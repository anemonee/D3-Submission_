Exploring Titanic Dataset for Udacity Data Analysis Course.

Summary: In the given visualization, I have explored the relationship of Titanic Survivors with their Age and Sex. The graph displays how adult males did not survive the attack compared to females, and young males.

Design: In the given visualization, I chose to display age in ascending order so that one can clearly see how suvival varies with age. I added an animation to explore the survival rates difference in the two genders.
Upon feedback, I inverted the colours of the bars - showing blue for survival and red for not survival. I changed this because I got the feedback that red intuitively seemed like "not survived", while in my earlier graph it stood for survival.
Upon feedback, I also added clear legeneds for which sex a viewer is viewing data for. I received feedback that it was not clear in my previous graph.

Feedback: The main feedback I received was:
1) The graph displayed the relationship well and what clearly stood out was that more females survived the titanic disaster, while most adult males did not.
2) Age had to be sorted in ascending order
3) The selection of male/female was not clear in my previous graph and that I corrected, and also increased frame time to let the reader dwell on the screen for longer time
4) Red should display "not survived" instead of "survived". The graphs became more clear once I did this.
